    <h2 class="monkey2">Monkey</h2>
    <p class="monkeytext">This is a monkey. Monkey is a common name that may refer to most mammals<br> of the infraorder Simiiformes, also known as simians. Traditionally, all animals in<br> the group now known as simians are counted as monkeys except the apes. Thus<br> monkeys, in that sense, constitute an incomplete paraphyletic grouping; alternatively,<br> if apes (Hominoidea) are included, monkeys and simians are synonyms.</p>
    <p class="monkeytext2">Many monkey species are tree-dwelling (arboreal), although there are species<br> that live primarily on the ground, such as baboons. Most species are mainly active<br> during the day (diurnal). Monkeys are generally considered to be intelligent,<br> especially the Old World monkeys.</p>
