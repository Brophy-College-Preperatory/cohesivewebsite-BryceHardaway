<p class="pandatext" style="color: white;">The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca), also known as the panda bear or simply panda,<br> is a bear species endemic to China. It is characterised by its white coat with black patches<br> around the eyes, ears, legs and shoulders. Its body is rotund; adult individuals weigh 100<br> to 115 kg (220 to 254 lb) and are typically 1.2 to 1.9 m (3 ft 11 in to 6 ft 3 in) long. It is<br> sexually dimorphic, with males being typically 10 to 20% larger than females. A thumb<br> is visible on its forepaw, which helps in holding bamboo in place for feeding. It has large<br> molar teeth and expanded temporal fossa to meet its dietary requirements. It can digest<br> starch and is mostly herbivorous with a diet consisting almost entirely of bamboo and bamboo shoots.</p>
